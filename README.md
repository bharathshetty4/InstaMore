# Some Good Habits to Follow in a Project
1. Use Package/Repo Management tool for a Project. In this project we are
Using [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) which is taking care of it.
You can find the *glide.yaml* of this project to know more.

2. Maintain a file to describe and document RESTful APIs in a Project. We are
Using [Swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) Tool, Which can also
create the CLI for us using the *swagger.yaml*.
You can refer the *swagger.yaml* of this project to know more.

3. There are many libraries available in go, Use it whenever possible.
To build a CLI, In this project we are
using [cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli) library,
[viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for config file management and the
lists will go on as the feature increases.

4. Make use free opensource tools to keep your code clean and unbreakable,
We are using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/bharathshetty4/InstaMore) for
code check.
